            <p>Summoning your courage, you step forward. The shadowy figure becomes clearer—it is the lost child from the diary. His hollow eyes lock onto yours.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, the house shakes as you feel a presence leave. The child fades away, and the oppressive atmosphere lifts. You’ve freed the lost spirit.</p>
            <p>The house falls into peaceful silence, and you walk away, knowing you’ve put a lost soul to rest.</p>
