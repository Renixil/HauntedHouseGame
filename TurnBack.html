            <p>The wind howls behind you as if it’s trying to pull you back, but you don’t stop. Soon, you’re back at the entrance of the yard, your heartbeat finally slowing.</p>
            <p>You escape the house unscathed, but a gnawing sense of regret lingers. What could you have uncovered if you had dared to enter?</p>
