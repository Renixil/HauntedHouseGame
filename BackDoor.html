            <p>You slowly approach the back door, your footsteps soft on the overgrown grass. As you reach for the door, it swings open with a loud creak. The darkness inside beckons you.</p>
            <p>Stepping inside, the door slams shut behind you. You whirl around, but the handle is gone. Panic rises in your chest. In the corner of the room, you see a figureâ€”its face obscured, watching.</p>
            <p>Before you can react, the figure lunges at you, pulling you into the darkness. You scream, but no one will hear you in the depths of this cursed house.</p>
